          MHFC includes and addresses the externalized and internalized stigma around mental illness 
          and how it impacts the mental wellness of the African American community. Two of our signature 
          trainings, &ldquo;A Bridge Over Troubled Waters, The Spiritual Journey of African Americans from Slave Ships Through 
          The White House&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&lsquo;m A Winner Campaign&rdquo; identifes the historical causes and the impact 
          and burden African Americans carry with them and the environmental factors that contribute to poor outcomes 
          and a distrust of health systems.Through a series of workshops, congregational and community engagement 
          the program creates &ldquo;transformACTIONal&rdquo; partnerships between faith-based corganizations, 
          mental health providers, County Behaviorial Health Care Departments and the African American community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also offer an online directory of health care providers and support groups based 
          in Alameda County that offer faith-based treatments and services meant to treat 
          mental conditions.

        <h2>Why Mental Health Friendly Communities?</h2>
        <p>
          There is an urgent need to reduce mental health stigma and disparity within the African American community. 
          It is our mission, passion and purpose to continue to fuel the movementin California to amplify 
          and address this urgent need through active and intentional engagement of the African American 
          faith community. Although anyone can develop a mental health problem, African Americans sometimes 
          experience more severe forms of mental health conditions due to unmet needs and other barriers. 
          According to the Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, African Americans are 
          20% more likely to experience serious mental health problems than the general population due 
          to social determinant factors and institutional racism. 
        </p>
        <p>
          MHFC embraces culturally congruent practices that have been deemed as community defined or promising 
          for the African American community. We identify and partner with cultural brokers and other subject matter 
          experts to ensure that we remain culturally astute and honoring of all faith and spiritual practices, identifed 
          from within the community, that promote wellness for African American consumers and family members. Faith 
          and spirituality have been widely and historically identified as primary protective factors and wellness tools 
          for many African Americans experiencing personal, family and community challenges
